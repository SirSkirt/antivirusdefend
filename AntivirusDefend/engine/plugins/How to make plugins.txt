Antivirus Defend – Game Mode Plugins (.gmemde)
================================================

This engine is evolving to support plug-in game modes.

Right now, the Freeplay mode is still implemented in JavaScript
(see engine/plugins/gamemodes/freeplay.js). The .gmemde file is
used as metadata and as a template for future config-only modes.

Where plugins live
------------------

All gamemode plugins live under:

  AntivirusDefend/engine/plugins/gamemodes/

Each mode gets its own folder, for example:

  AntivirusDefend/engine/plugins/gamemodes/Freeplay/
  AntivirusDefend/engine/plugins/gamemodes/TowerDefense/

Inside that folder, there should be at least ONE file:

  <Something>.gmemde   (the manifest for that mode)

Freeplay example
----------------

  {
    "id": "freeplay",
    "name": "Freeplay",
    "description": "Endless survival mode with ramsticks, waves, and upgrades.",
    "engineVersion": "A.0.4.9",
    "modeType": "freeplay_core",
    "ui": {
      "theme": {
        "accent": "#38bdf8",
        "panel": "#020617"
      }
    }
  }

Later versions will add templates that can read .gmemde files to
build full modes without writing JavaScript. For now, treat
.gmemde as the manifest / metadata for a mode.
